// Problem: "Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, and so on.  By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."
// Goal: Create a variable finalNumber and have it be equal to the sum of all the even fibonacci numbers less than 4 million
// Steps: Use 2 variables to create the fibonacci sequence, then stick that in a for loop that checks if each new fibonacci value % 2 = 0, and is < 4000000

var finalNumber = 0;
var fibonacciOne = 1;
var fibonacciTwo = 1;
var currentFibonacci = 1;

while (currentFibonacci < 4000000) {
    console.log (currentFibonacci);
    if (currentFibonacci % 2 == 0) {
        console.log (currentFibonacci + " is an even fibonacci number!");
        finalNumber = finalNumber + currentFibonacci;
        console.log ("Because of this, " + currentFibonacci + " has been added to the former sum. The new sum is " + finalNumber + "!");
    }
    currentFibonacci = fibonacciOne + fibonacciTwo;
    fibonacciTwo = fibonacciOne;
    fibonacciOne = currentFibonacci;
}

console.log ("The final sum is " + finalNumber + "!");
